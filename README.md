#Picsum Image Gallery Web App — React.js, Axios, Tailwind CSS

Built a dynamic and responsive image gallery using React.js, integrating the Picsum API to fetch 30 images per page with smooth pagination.

Implemented real-time API requests using Axios, along with a loading state, manual refresh, and interactive card animations for improved UX.

Designed a modern, visually appealing interface with Tailwind CSS, including hover effects, overlays, shadows, and animated transitions.

Added image preview functionality by linking to high-resolution versions and providing a “View Image” button inside a hover overlay.

Ensured clean component structure using React Hooks (useState, useEffect) and optimized rendering by resetting data during page navigation.
